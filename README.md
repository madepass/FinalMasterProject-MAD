# Characterization of Movement-related neural States in NHP's

This repository contains the scripts used to aggregate, pre-process, and analyze the EEG/LFP datasets. The project was supervised by Ignasi Cos at the University of Barcelona.

#### Abstract

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are subject of interest among researchers and clin-icians  due  its  high  mortality  rate.   Cardiac  Magnetic  resonance  (CMR)  is  the  reference  for  clinicians  to  analyze  the  heart  tissues  by  visual  assessment  and  crudequantitative measures of the structures to dictate a diagnosis of the patientâ€™s status. Radiomics is a novel image analysis technique extract a large number of quantitative features from CMR that provide insightful information of the heart structures to  support  clinicians  in  the  diagnosis  and  prognosis  of  these  diseases.   Previous studies have demonstrated the capacity of these features to obtain higher diagnosis accuracy than conventional methods. In this study, we cover in-depth Radiomicstechnique and explore two types of radiomics: Hand-Crafted Radiomics (HCR) and Deep Learning-based Radiomics (DLR). HCR computes a wide range of researcherdefined
quantitative features that measure the shape, intensity, and texture of image regions of interest. DLR arefeatures extracted based in the training of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We  address  the  methodology for  the  extraction  of  the  features  for  both  methods and analyze the performance in the CVDs classification task with Machine Learn-ing (ML) algorithm. We also develop a pipeline for the fusion of these features withthe aim of collecting complementary information of the heart structures from both mentioned methods with the aim of improving diagnostic accuracy.  We apply this methodology with two benchmark medical datasets: ACDC Challenge dataset andUK BioBank with the availability of both CMR and the segmentation of the heart structures:  Myocardium  (MYO),  Right  Ventricle  (RV)  and  Left  Ventricle  (LV).  We perform an analysis of the results, discuss challenges and elaborate on future work.
